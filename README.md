# Undergraduate course materials for Applied Math Students at HIT

This repository constitutes a comprehensive archive of specialized course materials throughout my undergraduate tenure. It is intended to serve as a pedagogical reference for prospective mathematics students, with a particular focus on those enrolled in the HIT-SPbU (Harbin Institute of Technology and Saint Petersburg State University) Joint Excellence Program.

Any contributions, such as supplementary notes or constructive suggestions, are sincerely welcomed. Furthermore, should you encounter any errors or oversights within these materials, I would be most grateful if you could bring them to my attention via the following email address: `kieran_liky AT 163 DOT com`

## Who need this

This repository is intended as a resource for students seeking to achieve academic excellence or to streamline their examination preparation within the HIT-SPbSU Joint Program. Furthermore, it serves as a comparative reference for mathematics scholars interested in exploring the pedagogical nuances and curriculum disparities between the Russian and Chinese traditions of undergraduate mathematical education.

## Contents of Each Course

For each course, the following resources are typically provided:

- Lecture Notes/Slides: Official instructional materials provided by the instructors.

- Home Assignments and Solutions: Problem sets with detailed solutions, either typeset in LaTeX or handwritten by the author.

- Personal Notes: <br> Files named after the course title consist of notes taken during lectures. <br> Files labeled with "Notes" or "Review" represent systematic syntheses and summaries compiled during the revision phase.

- Computational Modules: Source code and technical documentation required for laboratory or programming sessions.

- Course Syllabi & Topic Lists: Comprehensive content checklists provided by instructors, serving as a formal reference for final examinations.

- *References: To respect intellectual property rights, external textbooks are generally excluded unless they serve as the primary lecture notes. For inquiries regarding recommended readings or electronic resources, please contact the author directly.*

## Important Notes & Disclaimers

- Completeness: Due to temporal constraints, certain course materials may be incomplete. Contributions from the community to fill these gaps are highly encouraged and appreciated.

- Language Consistency: Please note that the resources are documented in a mixture of Chinese and English (maybe even Russian). The choice of language was dictated by the author's convenience and the context of the discourse at the time, rather than any pedagogical preference.

- Curriculum Evolution: As the author belongs to the inaugural cohort of this joint program, the curriculum may still be in an exploratory phase. Prospective students should be aware that course content may evolve over time; therefore, these materials should be used as a supplementary reference rather than an absolute guide.

## Acknowledgements

I would like to express my sincere gratitude to all the instructors and professors for their insightful lectures and guidance. My thanks also extend to the colleagues who have provided valuable support and suggestions for the development of this repository.
