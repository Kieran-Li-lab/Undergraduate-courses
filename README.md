# Undergraduate Course Materials for Applied Math Students at HIT

This repository is a collection of the course materials I’ve gathered throughout my undergraduate years. I hope it can be a helpful reference for fellow math students, especially those in the **HIT-SPbU (Harbin Institute of Technology and Saint Petersburg State University) Joint Program**.

If you have any notes to add or suggestions to make, I’d love to hear them! Also, since these are personal records, there might be some mistakes or oversights—if you spot any, please let me know at: `kieran_liky AT 163 DOT com`

## A quick note
This repository actually started as a way to pass the time during my bouts of insomnia. It’s grown quite a bit since then, though you’ll notice the materials from my earlier years aren’t nearly as polished. My note-taking back then was a bit rough, so you might run into some messy parts or mistakes. Honestly, I don't have the time to go back and tidy everything up now, so please just take them as they are.

## Who is this for?
This repository is for anyone in the HIT-SPbU Joint Program looking to strengthen their understanding or just trying to survive finals week. It might also be interesting for those who want to see the differences (and the "pedagogical nuances," if we’re being fancy) between the Russian and Chinese traditions of math education.

> **Note:** Most of these materials are foundational. If you’re already an advanced scholar looking for deep, specialized research, these might be a bit too basic for you.

## What’s inside?
For most courses, you’ll find:

* **Lecture Notes/Slides:** Official materials from the instructors.
* **Assignments and Solutions:** Problem sets with solutions I either typeset in **LaTeX** or scribbled by hand.
* **Personal Notes:** * Files named after the **course title** are my in-class notes. Most have a table of contents, so you can use the **bookmark** feature in your PDF reader to jump around.
    * Files labeled **"Notes"** or **"Review"** are my personal summaries from when I was cramming for exams.
* **Computational Modules:** Code and docs for the lab sessions.
* **Syllabi & Topic Lists:** The "checklists" provided by teachers to help us prepare for finals.
* **Mind Maps:** In some folders, you’ll find mind maps I scrambled to put together during finals week. They're great for getting the **overall logic** down quickly—perfect for a quick review before you dive into the details.
* ***References:** To respect copyright, I haven't included textbooks unless they were the actual handouts. If you need book recommendations or e-resources, feel free to ask me.*

## Important Notes & Disclaimers
* **About Completeness:** Since I was juggling a lot of coursework, I couldn't always keep everything organized—so you might find some files missing. If you happen to have any of those missing materials and are willing to share, I'd be super grateful!
* **On Language:** You’ll see a mix of Chinese, English, and maybe some Russian. It basically depended on how I was feeling or what was easiest to jot down at the time. I know it’s a bit messy, so thanks for bearing with me.
* **Things Change:** Being in the very first group of this program, I was kind of a **"guinea pig"** and we were all just figuring things out. The courses have probably evolved since then, so please don't take my notes as the absolute truth—they’re just how I personally understood things at the time.
