This folder integrates the materials from 3 courese:

Introduction of Dynamical System, Stability of Dynamical System, Optimal Control, the first course is offered in 3 Spring, while the latter two are offered in 3 Summer.

Since the application season for graduate study approaching, the author has been occupied lately. Those material were lack of organization. But I still believe those would be enough for some one who only want to pass the examine.
